        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>You can't say "Lousiana cooking" without conjuring up images of a certain set
            of foods. Among them, boiled crawfish, gumbo, and of course, dirty rice.<br>
            Dirty rice may be one of the most versatille foods in the Cajun arsenal. It
            is sometimes refered to as "rice dressing", as it often is used to stuff turkey,<br>
            chicken, quail, and bell peppers. It can stand alone as a main dish, or blend in 
            to a table of side dishes at your next potluck. But like all cuisine rooted in the<br>
            south, this dish is packed full of savory flavor and always a crowd pleaser.
        </p>
        <p>Now, anybody can slap together rice and meat, but to really capture the essence
            of the dish we must include two very important features. First, the holy trinity of<br>
            southern cooking: onion, bell pepper, and celery. Second, something to give texture
            and cohesion to the dish. Nobody likes chasing dry, scattered rice around their plate.<br>
            For this version, we will be using bacon grease and flour to create out binding agent, 
            and pack in a bit of extra flavor. As always, southern cooking has as many variations <br>
            as it does families who make it, so feel free to experiment with you own twist on this 
            classic dish to make it truly your own.

        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>white rice</li>
                <li>ground beed</li>
                <li>ground sausage</li>
                <li>bell pepper</li>
                <li>onion</li>
                <li>celery</li>
                <li>chicken broth</li>
                <li>flour</li>
                <li>cooking oil (I prefer bacon grease, but peanut oil is also a good choice)</li>
                <li>spices: chili powder, oregano, parsley, thyme, paprika, bay leaves,<br>
                    garlic, salt, pepper, cayenne</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <p>Apart from boiling the rice, this entire recipe can be done in a single cast iron skillet,<br>
            stock pot, or deep skillet. Use what works best for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook you rice and set aside</li>
                <li>In your main skillet, heat bacon grease or oil in your skillet over medium heat. Add ground beed and sausage<br>
                and mix them together as they begin to brown</li>
                <li>Add the holy trinity (diced onion, celery, and bell pepper)</li>
                <li>Stir in all of the spices, except for the parsley. This is a great time to savor the aromas!</li>
                <li>Sprinkle a bit of flour over the meat. Use enough to coat the meat, but not so much that you get<br>
                clumps of cooked flour</li>
                <li>Stir in the chicken broth and allow to simmer for 5-8 minutes</li>
                <li>Fold in the cooked rice and parsley. Simmer for another 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Serve and enojoy!</li>
            </ol>
