        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>We all have foods that are deeply attached to our childhood memories.
            For some, that may be grilled cheese or dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets.<br>
            But if you had a southern mom, it was more likely <a href="./dirty-rice.html">dirty rice</a>
            or etouffee. This was certainly the case for me! Though this southern classic can be made entirely<br>
            from scratch, an ingenious mother with kids to feed can make smart use of the soup aisle at the grocery
            store to take some of the pain out of providing her family with a quality dinner. This recipe will<br>
            be of exactly that type. 
        </p>
        <p>Etouffee is a savory, tomato-based sauce served over rice. It can be done with shrimp or crawfish, and is
            sure to be a family favorite in the southern comfort-food arsenal.
