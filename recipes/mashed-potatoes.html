        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>This recipe came down from my Grandfather, Bill Jowers. In proper 
            old school, southern cooking fashion, it is really more of a guide <br>
            than a set of exact measurements. This recipe shies away from the 
            usual form normally associated with traditional smashed spuds and <br>
            showcases a bit of true southern spirit to create a side that is both 
            deliciously spiced as well as soul-soothingly rich. This take on <br>
            mashed potatoes the reason that food ever came to be described with
            words like "soul" and "comfort".</p>
