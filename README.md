Odin Project Recipe Page

This was a fun project. I had just started on it when I had to take an unexpected 2 week break.
My first child, a baby boy named Theodore, decided to come amonth early, and I spent two weeks with him
and my wife in the hospital. Though I tried to fit in time to continue this learning process, life in the hospital is a bit too hectic for much meaningful focus. 

Getting back to this project helped greatly to refresh many of the skills that I had been picking up over the last month. I got to brush up on some of my linux terminal commands, crystalize the  html boilerplate in my brain, and made solid use of the < img > and < a href > tags. I tried to add a little extra flair, but I stuck close to the script for this project, as I imagine the CSS portion will assume that the content is formatted as instructed. 

One thing that did become a little more clear to me was writing the appropriate file paths for sourcing images and links. I have links form the home page to each recipe, and I added a home page to each of those, but I also made a link from one recipe page to the other just to make sure I had the path scheme ironed out. 

Also, I may be in serious need of dirty rice and crawfish etouffee soon.
